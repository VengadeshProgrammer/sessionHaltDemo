# 🔐 SessionHalt

> **Prevent Session Hijacking Before It Happens.**  
> A lightweight, client-side hijacking detection and prevention system built to protect user sessions from real-world threats.

---

## 📌 Overview

SessionHalt is an advanced **Session Hijacking Prevention and Response System** inspired by real security threats on social media and web platforms. It uses **canvas fingerprinting**, **user agent matching**, **SHA-256 hashing**, **XSS input sanitization**, and **tamper detection** to create a secure and responsive web experience.

This project was built as part of the **Samsung Solve for Tomorrow 2025** initiative to demonstrate how modern session-level threats can be tackled using clever, lightweight client-side logic.

## 🛡️ How It Works

SessionHalt continuously checks and validates session identity by:

- Matching stored canvas fingerprint with the current device's.
- Ensuring the canvas fingerprinting function has **not been overridden**.
- Verifying browser **UserAgent string** hasn't changed or been spoofed.
- Checking for **XSS attacks** in every critical field, including inputs and localStorage.
- Encrypting session identifiers using **SHA-256**.
- Automatically logging out users if **any tampering is detected**, by clearing localStorage and redirecting to the signup page.

---

## 🧪 Simulated Attacks (By Me!)

I created **3 browser extensions** to simulate:
- Session ID theft
- User Agent spoofing
- Canvas fingerprint hijacking

These attacks were tested against SessionHalt and **successfully blocked in real time**, as shown in the live demo video.

## 📊 Performance Results

| Condition                        | Session Hijacking Rate |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Without SessionHalt              | ~85%                    |
| With SessionHalt Activated       | **<2%**                 |

## 🔍 Security Note

While no system is unbreakable, SessionHalt raises the difficulty of session spoofing to the point where **an attacker would need to recompile or alter the browser engine itself** — making real-world exploitation highly unlikely.

---

## 📦 Future Plans

If this project reaches the **Top 10** in Samsung Solve for Tomorrow 2025, I plan to:

- 💡 Package SessionHalt as a scalable **JavaScript module**.
- 🧩 Provide **plug-and-play APIs** for developers to secure their platforms with just **one or two lines of code**.
- 🌍 Make secure sessions accessible to **everyone, everywhere**.

---

## 🧠 Author's Note

This project is the result of deep personal research, hands-on experimentation, and countless hours of thought and testing. With no access to identical devices (due to limited second-hand availability), I built the canvas fingerprint logic to still be reliable using advanced matching logic and real-world conditions.

Even major companies overlook this layer of security while focusing on AI. But security matters **now**.
